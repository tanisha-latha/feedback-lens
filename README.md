# Feedback Lens

Feedback Lens is a lightweight prototype built on Cloudflare Workers that helps product managers turn unstructured customer feedback into a structured PM readout (summary, sentiment, themes, urgency).

**Live demo:** https://feedback-lens.tanisha-portfolio.workers.dev

## What this demonstrates
- Rapid prototyping using Cloudflare Workers
- Lightweight persistence with Cloudflare KV
- Real-time analysis using Cloudflare Workers AI
- Composing multiple Cloudflare products with minimal infrastructure

This project was built as part of a Cloudflare product exercise focused on developer experience, onboarding friction, and platform composability.
